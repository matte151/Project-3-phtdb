## Next Steps
* AAU (Vet):  After a surgery I want to set up the system to send them daily reminder emails to log in and track progress without my having to do anything else, for X number of days.  Because I'm busy and I want the info.
* AAU (Client): When I update I want it to send an email to my vet, because it might be urgent.
